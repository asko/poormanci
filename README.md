When you want to have little-to-zero cost of running CICD for your pet project 

# Mission
1. We see the future world with more inventors and better products in it.
2. We believe that modern world should enable you as an engineer to try out your idea for free (if it didn't fly then it's better not to have spent on it).
3. We believe that you should be enabled to benefit from best practices of Continuous Delivery.

That's why we've created this project, to document our thinking, our journey to such solution and share what we have found along the way.
